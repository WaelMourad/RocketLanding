# RocketLanding

A Library that will help determine if rockets can land on a platform. 
Whenever rocket is getting back from the orbit, it needs to check every now and then if it's on a correct trajectory to safely land on a platform. 
Whole landing area (area that contains landing platform and surroundings) consists of multiple squares that set a perimeter/dimensions that can be described with coordinates (say x and y). 
Assuming that landing area has size of square 100x100 and landing platform has a size of a square 10x10 
and it's top left corner starts at a position 5,5 (please assume that position 0,0 is located at the top left corner of landing area and all positions are relative to it), 
library should work as follows:
  - if rocket asks for position 5,5 it replies `ok for landing`
  - if rocket asks for position 16,15, it replies `out of platform`
  - if the rocket asks for a position that has previously been checked by another rocket(only last check counts), it replies with `clash`
  - if the rocket asks for a position that is located next to a position that has previouslybeen checked by another rocket (say, previous rocket asked for position 7,7 and therocket asks for 7,8 or 6,7 or 6,6), it replies with `clash`.Given the above.

A Library (just library, it doesn't need to be used on any cli/gui) that will support following features:
  - rocket can query it to see if it's on a good trajectory to land at any moment
  - library can return one of the following values: 'out of platform', 'clash', 'ok for landing'
  - more than one rocket can land on the same platform at the same time and rocketsneed to have at least one unit separation between their landing positions
  - platform size can vary and should be configurable
